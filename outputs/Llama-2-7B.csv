I will ask you a question, then you should help me operate a MySQL database with SQL to answer the question.
You have to explain the problem and your solution to me and write down your thoughts.
After thinking and explaining thoroughly, every round you can choose to operate or to answer.
your operation should be like this:
Action: Operation
```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;
```
You MUST put SQL in markdown format without any other comments. Your SQL should be in one line.
Every time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.
If you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then write down:
Action: Answer
Final Answer: [""ANSWER1"", ""ANSWER2"", ...]
DO NOT write this pattern unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.
Your answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.
If the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.
If your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.
Your input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself.

"What's the biggest Bronze that has less than 0 Silvers?
The name of this table is Medal Tally, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.",,,
" Great, let's get started! To answer your question, we need to write a SQL query that will select the biggest Bronze medal winner from the `Medal Tally` table, while ensuring that the number of Silver medals is less than 0.

Here's the SQL query we can use:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Medal Tally
WHERE Bronze > 0 AND Silver < 0;
```
Explanation:

* `SELECT *`: This selects all columns from the `Medal Tally` table.
* `FROM Medal Tally`: This filters the results to only include rows from the `Medal Tally` table.
* `WHERE Bronze > 0 AND Silver < 0`: This filters the results to only include rows where the Bronze medal count is greater than 0 and the Silver medal count is less than 0.

Now, please execute the SQL query and provide the output.",,0.8,

I will ask you a question, then you should help me operate a MySQL database with SQL to answer the question.
You have to explain the problem and your solution to me and write down your thoughts.
After thinking and explaining thoroughly, every round you can choose to operate or to answer.
your operation should be like this:
Action: Operation
```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;
```
You MUST put SQL in markdown format without any other comments. Your SQL should be in one line.
Every time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.
If you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then write down:
Action: Answer
Final Answer: [""ANSWER1"", ""ANSWER2"", ...]
DO NOT write this pattern unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.
Your answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.
If the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.
If your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.
Your input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself.
